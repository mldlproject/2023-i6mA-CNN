## Motivation
N6-methyladenine (6mA) is one of the most occurring epigenetic modifications of DNA
sequences found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In prokaryotes, 6mA is closely associated
with various biochemical processes such as DNA replication, repair, transcription, and cellular
defense. While in eukaryotes, biological roles and behaviors of this methylation type have not
been fully understood. Therefore, gaining more knowledge about 6mA sites is important and
contributes to uncovering the characteristics and unexplored biological functions of 6mA. In our
study, we propose an effective computational method called i6mA-CNN using convolutional
neural networks featured by multiple receptive fields. The 6mA-determined sequences of Mus
musculus (mice) were retrieved from the MethSMRT database and then refined to create a benchmark dataset.

## Results
To fairly evaluate the model performance, we performed multiple experiments
and compared i6mA-CNN with other methods on the same independent test set. The results
indicated that i6mA-CNN had achieved better performance with a value of 0.98 for both the
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the precision-recall
curve.
